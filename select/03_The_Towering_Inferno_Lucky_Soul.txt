Well all the luck in the world won't save me, baby.
'Cause I was hungry but now I'm starving, darling,
Believe me, believe me.

The towing inferno inside me,
May one day consume and devour me.
Well I say " Let it burn! Let it burn!"
Ain't never gonna satisfy me.

Well I tried but I can't behave like others, lover.
For the hunger forever keeps me apart, sweetheart.
Believe me, Believe me.

The towing inferno inside me,
May one day consume and devour me.
Well I say " Let it burn! let it burn!"
Ain't never gonna satisfy me.

If there's fire in your eyes it's a half step from smiling to scowling.
I've been hurtin' so bad I can't tell if I'm burning or drowning.
So don't let me burn myself to the ground,
I've been begging so long that it's starting to sound like a come on,
A come on, a come on.

The towing inferno inside me,
May one day consume and devour me.
Well I say " Let it burn! let it burn!"
Ain't no one ever gonna save me.
Ain't no one ever gonna save me?
